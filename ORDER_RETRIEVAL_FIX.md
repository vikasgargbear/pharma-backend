# Order Retrieval Bug Fix

## Issue
After creating an order, the API was returning a 404 "Order not found" error even though the order was successfully created in the database.

## Root Cause
The order queries (SELECT, UPDATE) were not filtering by `org_id`, causing issues in a multi-tenant environment. Orders were created with a specific org_id but retrieved without that filter.

## Fix Applied
Added `org_id` filter to all order-related queries in `/api/routers/v1/orders.py`:

### 1. Get Order Function (Line 262)
```python
WHERE o.order_id = :id AND o.org_id = :org_id
```

### 2. Status Check Queries
```python
SELECT order_status FROM orders WHERE order_id = :id AND org_id = :org_id
```

### 3. Update Statements
```python
UPDATE orders SET ... WHERE order_id = :id AND org_id = :org_id
```

## Files Changed
- `/api/routers/v1/orders.py` - Added org_id filters to:
  - `get_order()` function
  - `confirm_order()` function
  - `generate_invoice()` function
  - `deliver_order()` function
  - All UPDATE statements

## Benefits
1. Fixes the 404 error after order creation
2. Ensures proper multi-tenant data isolation
3. Prevents cross-organization data access
4. Improves security

## Testing
After deployment, the complete order workflow should work:
1. Create order ✅
2. Retrieve order ✅
3. Confirm order ✅
4. Generate invoice ✅
5. Mark as delivered ✅
