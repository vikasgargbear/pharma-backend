# Purchase Upload Implementation Status

## ✅ Successfully Deployed to Production

### What's Working:

1. **Purchase Creation with Items** ✅
   - Successfully created purchase order with supplier auto-creation
   - Purchase ID: 2, Number: PO-20250719-0901
   - Items properly linked to purchase

2. **Purchase Items Retrieval** ✅
   - GET `/api/v1/purchases-enhanced/2/items` returns item details
   - Shows batch numbers, expiry dates, quantities

3. **Pending Receipts** ✅
   - GET `/api/v1/purchases-enhanced/pending-receipts` shows unreceived purchases
   - Properly tracking receipt status

### API Endpoints Available:

#### 1. Create Purchase from Parsed/Manual Data
```bash
POST /api/v1/purchase-upload/create-from-parsed
```
- Creates purchase with automatic supplier creation if needed
- Supports line items with batch/expiry tracking

#### 2. Enhanced Purchase Management
```bash
POST /api/v1/purchases-enhanced/with-items
GET /api/v1/purchases-enhanced/{purchase_id}/items
PUT /api/v1/purchases-enhanced/{purchase_id}/items/{item_id}
POST /api/v1/purchases-enhanced/{purchase_id}/receive
GET /api/v1/purchases-enhanced/pending-receipts
```

#### 3. PDF Upload (Ready but needs testing)
```bash
POST /api/v1/purchase-upload/parse-invoice
POST /api/v1/purchase-upload/validate-invoice
```

### Production Test Results:

```json
// Created Purchase
{
  "purchase_id": 2,
  "purchase_number": "PO-20250719-0901",
  "supplier": "Demo Pharma Distributors",
  "total": 5500.00,
  "items": 1
}

// Purchase Item
{
  "product": "Ibuprofen 400mg",
  "quantity": 200,
  "cost": 25.00,
  "batch": "DEMO-BATCH-001",
  "expiry": "2027-06-30"
}
```

### Known Issues:

1. **Goods Receipt Error** ⚠️
   - The inventory movement trigger needs updating to handle 'purchase' type
   - Fix: Update the trigger in Supabase with the updated SQL

2. **Regular Purchases GET** ⚠️
   - The `/api/v1/purchases/` endpoint has a bug (looking for non-existent product_id)
   - Workaround: Use `/api/v1/purchases-enhanced/` endpoints instead

### Next Steps:

1. **Update Database Trigger**
   - Run the updated `03c_inventory_movement_triggers.sql` in Supabase
   - This will fix the goods receipt functionality

2. **Test PDF Upload**
   - Upload a real pharmaceutical invoice PDF
   - Verify extraction accuracy
   - Test the review/edit workflow

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Create upload UI component
   - Build review/edit interface
   - Add goods receipt screen

### Summary:

The purchase upload system is successfully deployed and working in production. Manual purchase creation with line items is fully functional. The PDF parsing infrastructure is ready but needs real invoice testing. Once the database trigger is updated, the complete flow from purchase creation to goods receipt will be operational.
