# 🚀 Pharma Backend - Deployment Status & Progress

## Current Status: Fixing Deployment Issues

### ✅ Completed Work

1. **Project Cleanup**
   - Removed 15+ temporary/test files
   - Cleaned up duplicate routers
   - Organized codebase structure

2. **Customer Management Module** 
   - Created complete enterprise customer system at `/api/v1/customers/*`
   - Features: GST validation, credit limits, ledger, payments
   - Architecture: routers/services/schemas separation

3. **Order Management Module**
   - Created schemas for complete order workflow
   - Created service layer with inventory allocation
   - Ready for router implementation

4. **Deployment Fixes Applied**
   - Fixed Pydantic v2 compatibility (regex → pattern)
   - Resolved schema import conflicts
   - Added backward compatibility layer
   - Removed problematic crud_base dependencies

### 🔧 Current Issues

The Railway deployment is experiencing 502 errors due to import issues:
- Products router had dependencies on non-existent `crud_base` module
- Schema imports were conflicting between module and package

### 🛠️ Fixes Applied (Awaiting Deployment)

1. **Commit b837ce0**: Added backward compatibility for schemas
2. **Commit aae7fd0**: Removed crud_base dependencies from products router

### 📊 API Structure

```
/                           # API info
/health                     # Health check
/products/                  # Product management
/customers-simple/          # Simple customer operations
/api/v1/customers/          # Enterprise customer management
/db-inspect/*              # Database tools
/organizations/            # Organization management
```

### 🎯 Next Steps

Once deployment is stable:
1. Test customer endpoints
2. Complete order management router
3. Implement inventory management
4. Add GST/billing features

### 📝 Testing

Test scripts available:
- `test_customer_endpoints.py` - Full customer API tests
- `test_simple_customers.py` - Simple customer tests
- `check_api_status.py` - Deployment status checker

### 🏗️ Architecture Implemented

```
api/
├── routers/
│   ├── v1/                 # Versioned enterprise APIs
│   │   └── customers.py
│   └── customers_simple.py # Simple APIs for compatibility

```

The system is being built following enterprise patterns with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive validation, and business logic isolation.
