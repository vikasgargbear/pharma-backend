# Railway Deployment Issue Summary

## Current Situation (2025-07-19)

### URLs Tested:
1. **https://pharma-backend-production.up.railway.app**
   - Status: Running Express.js (NOT our Python/FastAPI backend)
   - Returns: "Cannot GET /" errors typical of Express.js
   - Headers: `x-powered-by: Express`

2. **https://pharma-backend.railway.app**
   - Status: Running a different service
   - `/health` returns plain text "OK"
   - Other endpoints return "Not Found"
   - NOT our FastAPI application

3. **https://aaso-pharma-backend-production.up.railway.app**
   - Status: Application not found (404)

### Our Backend Status:
- ✅ Code is working perfectly locally
- ✅ All endpoints tested successfully
- ✅ Database triggers compatible
- ✅ Dockerfile configured correctly
- ✅ railway.json configured correctly
- ✅ Procfile pointing to correct start.py

### The Issue:
The URLs we're testing are NOT running our Python/FastAPI backend. They appear to be:
1. A Node.js/Express.js application (possibly your frontend)
2. A different service that just responds "OK" to health checks

### Action Required:
1. **Log into Railway Dashboard** and check:
   - How many services are deployed
   - What are the correct URLs for each service
   - Check if the Python backend service is running
   - Look at deployment logs for any errors

2. **Verify Service Names**:
   - The backend service might have a different URL
   - Check if there's a service specifically named "pharma-backend" vs "pharma-frontend"

3. **Check Deployment Logs**:
   - See if the Python service failed to start
   - Check for any build errors
   - Verify environment variables are set

### Local Testing Results:
All APIs work correctly when running locally:
- ✅ Sales Returns API
- ✅ Stock Adjustments API
- ✅ Physical Count API
- ✅ Expire Batches API
- ✅ Tax Calculation API

### Next Steps:
1. Access Railway dashboard to find the correct backend URL
2. Check if multiple services exist
3. Verify which service is which
4. Get the correct URL for the Python/FastAPI backend
5. Test the correct URL with our endpoints
