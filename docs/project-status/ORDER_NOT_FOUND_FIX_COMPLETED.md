# Order Not Found Error - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Summary
Users were experiencing "Order 43 not found" and "Order 44 not found" errors when saving invoices through the frontend, even though orders were being created successfully in the database.

## Root Cause
The `org_id` field was missing when creating orders, causing multi-tenant query filters to fail when retrieving the order.

## Fix Applied
Added code to ensure `org_id` is always set in the order creation endpoint:

```python
# In /api/routers/v1/orders.py, lines 114-116
# Ensure org_id is set (critical for multi-tenant queries)
if "org_id" not in order_data:
    order_data["org_id"] = DEFAULT_ORG_ID
```

## Test Results
✅ **Order Creation Test**: Successfully created order with ID 45
✅ **Order Retrieval Test**: Successfully retrieved the same order
✅ **Frontend Integration**: Invoice creation now works end-to-end

## Verification Steps
1. Create an invoice in the frontend
2. Save the invoice
3. Order should be created and retrievable without errors
4. WhatsApp share should work with correct order details

- `/api/routers/v1/orders.py` - Added org_id validation in create_order function

## Status
**RESOLVED** - Orders are now created with proper org_id and can be retrieved successfully.
