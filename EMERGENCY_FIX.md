# Emergency Fix Steps

The application keeps crashing with 502 errors. Here's what's happening:

1. **Import Chain**: main.py → crud.py → expects many schemas/models
2. **Missing Dependencies**: crud.py has 1700+ lines expecting dozens of models

## Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Disable crud.py import
Remove `from . import crud` from main.py

### Option 2: Create ALL missing models
This is error-prone and time-consuming

### Option 3: Start fresh with minimal API
Create a new simple main.py without legacy code

## Recommendation:
Go with Option 1 - disable crud import since routers have their own CRUD logic.
