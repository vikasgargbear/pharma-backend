# Auto Batch Generation - Deployment Guide

## Current Status
The automatic batch generation feature is ready but needs deployment.

## What's Been Done

### 1. **Fixed Database Trigger** ✅
- `FIX_batch_creation_trigger_v2.sql` has been run
- Auto-generates batch numbers when null
- Format: `AUTO-YYYYMMDD-PRODUCTID-XXXX`

### 2. **Fixed API Endpoint** ✅
- Added `/receive-fixed` endpoint
- Doesn't create batches directly
- Lets the trigger handle batch creation

### 3. **Removed Column Error** ✅
- Fixed `updated_at` column reference

## Deploy Steps

1. **Deploy the API changes**:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

2. **Test with the fixed endpoint**:
   ```bash
   python test_auto_batch_fixed.py
   ```

## How It Works

### Without Batch Number (Auto-Generated)
```json
POST /api/v1/purchases-enhanced/{id}/receive-fixed
{
  "items": [{
    "purchase_item_id": 1,
    "received_quantity": 100
    // No batch_number - trigger generates AUTO-20250720-14-1234
  }]
}
```

### With Custom Batch Number
```json
POST /api/v1/purchases-enhanced/{id}/receive-fixed
{
  "items": [{
    "purchase_item_id": 1,
    "received_quantity": 100,
    "batch_number": "CUSTOM-BATCH-001"
  }]
}
```

## Benefits

1. **PDF Parsing** - Works even if PDF doesn't have batch info
2. **Manual Entry** - No need to enter batch numbers manually
3. **Consistent Format** - AUTO- prefix identifies system batches
4. **No Duplicates** - Trigger checks before creating

## Next Steps

After deployment:
1. Use `/receive-fixed` endpoint for goods receipt
2. Original `/receive` endpoint can be deprecated
3. Test with PDFs missing batch information
