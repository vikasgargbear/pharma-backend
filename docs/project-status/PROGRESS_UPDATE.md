# 🚀 Enterprise Pharma System - Progress Update

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. **Project Cleanup & Organization**
- Removed 15+ temporary test files and backup files
- Cleaned up duplicate routers (products_simple, delivery_public)
- Fixed main.py imports for cleaner structure
- Removed problematic crud.py references

### 2. **Customer Management Module** 
Created a complete enterprise-grade customer management system with:

#### **Endpoints Implemented:**
- `POST /api/v1/customers` - Create customer with GST validation
- `GET /api/v1/customers` - List with search, filters, pagination
- `GET /api/v1/customers/{id}` - Get customer with statistics
- `PUT /api/v1/customers/{id}` - Update customer details
- `GET /api/v1/customers/{id}/ledger` - Transaction history
- `GET /api/v1/customers/{id}/outstanding` - Outstanding invoices
- `POST /api/v1/customers/{id}/payment` - Record payments
- `POST /api/v1/customers/{id}/check-credit` - Credit validation

#### **Features:**
- ✅ GST/PAN validation with regex patterns
- ✅ Credit limit management
- ✅ Multi-type support (retail/wholesale/hospital/clinic/pharmacy)
- ✅ Automatic customer code generation
- ✅ Outstanding calculation
- ✅ Payment auto-allocation to oldest invoices
- ✅ Ledger with running balance
- ✅ Business statistics tracking

#### **Architecture:**
```

├── routers/
│   └── v1/
│       └── customers.py      # RESTful endpoints
├── services/
│   └── customer_service.py   # Business logic
└── schemas/
    └── customer.py           # Pydantic models
```

## 🏗️ Next Steps (As Per IMMEDIATE_ACTION_PLAN.md)

## 📊 Current Status

- **Deployment**: Code pushed to Railway, awaiting deployment completion
- **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite for customer endpoints
- **Documentation**: Created planning documents (ENTERPRISE_PHARMA_BLUEPRINT.md, IMMEDIATE_ACTION_PLAN.md)

## 🎯 Week 1 Goals Progress

- [x] Project cleanup and organization
- [x] Customer management (Day 1-2)
- [ ] Order management (Day 3-4)
- [ ] Inventory management (Day 5)

## 💡 Technical Decisions Made

1. **Separated schemas into dedicated directory** - Better organization
2. **Created service layer** - Business logic separation from routes
3. **Used direct SQL for complex queries** - Better performance than ORM
4. **Implemented v1 API versioning** - Future-proof architecture
5. **Added comprehensive validation** - GST, PAN, phone numbers

## 🔧 Deployment Notes

- Pushed to `main` branch
- Railway auto-deployment triggered
- Customer endpoints will be available at `/api/v1/customers/*`
- Test script ready at `test_customer_endpoints.py`

The foundation for a world-class enterprise pharma system is now in place!
